# My React Vite Project

This is a simple React project bootstrapped with Vite.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher is recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm**: npm is typically installed with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/malik-dinar/Contacts.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Install all the necessary project dependencies by running:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the listed packages.

3.  **Run the development server**:
    Start the development server. This will typically open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    You should now see your React application running in your browser. Any changes you make to the source code will trigger a hot reload, updating the browser automatically.
